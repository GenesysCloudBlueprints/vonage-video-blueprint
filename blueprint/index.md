Genesys Cloud uses **Interaction Widget** to provide customers with a Vonage Video interaction.

![Flowchart](images/flowchart.png "Flowchart")

## Sample Application Features

- **Interaction Widget** - Uses the Genesys Cloud's Interaction Widget to enable the agent to start a Vonage room inside Genesys Cloud.
- **Start Vonage rooms** - Allows an agent to start a Vonage room from Genesys Cloud.
- **Send Vonage Invite** - Sends the invite or room link to a customer via Chat, SMS or email.
- **Multiple Interaction Support** - Supports multiple interactions from different interaction channels in Genesys Cloud.
- **Screen Share** - Utilizes the screen share functionality of the Vonage Video API to allow the agent and/or the customer to share their screen.
- **Save Session ID** - Adds a note in the Genesys Cloud interaction detail to save the Vonage Video's session ID.

## Solution components

- **Genesys Cloud** - The Genesys cloud-based contact center platform. Genesys Cloud is the platform for the Vonage Video solution.
- **Genesys AppFoundry** - The Genesys AppFoundry is an app marketplace for solutions that run on the Genesys Cloud platform. You get the Vonage Video integration used in the solution from the Genesys AppFoundry.
- **Interaction Widget Integration** - This integration type enables web apps to be embedded in an iframe within Genesys Cloud. Each iframe is unique to an interaction and will only show when the interaction is being offered or received by an agent. The client app for this blueprint will be embedded via this integration type.
- **Vonage** - Vonage is a telecommunications service provider based on voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
- **Vonage Video API platform** - This platform makes it easy to embed real-time high quality interactive video, messaging, screen-sharing and more into web ang mobile applicaitons. The platform includews client libraries for web, iOS, Andriod and Windows as well as server-side SDKs and REST API. The Vonage Video API uses WebRTC for audio-video communications.
- **NodeJS App and Web Server** - Vonage Video API applications requires both a client and server component. The server component generates new sessions and tokens which it sends to the client. This blueprint includes a script that will run the Web Server which provides the client pages and the Vonage App server which uses the Vonage Video NodeJS Server SDK.

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

- **Genesys Cloud Platform API SDK** - This SDK is used for the initial interaction of agent and customer over chat, SMS and email channels.
- **Genesys Cloud Client App SDK** - This SDK allows the client app to subscribe to lifecycle hooks of the integration and invoke functions accordingly.
- **Vonage Video Client Web SDK** - This SDK is used to create and start a Vonage Video room for the agent and customer to have a video interaction with screen sharing.
- **Vonage Video Server NodeJS SDK** - This SDK is used to generate sessions and tokens.

The solutions engineer requires a Vonage Video account to create a project and generate a Project API Key and Project Secret.

## Run Locally

The Vonage Video integration has the following stages:

- Download the repository containing the project files.
- Create a Client Credentials OAuth Grant for Genesys Cloud.
- Create or use existing Vonage Video API credentials.
- Host and run the NodeJS app server.
- Install and activate the Vonage Video integration app on Genesys Cloud.
- Create a Genesys web chat widget and test the Vonage Video solution.

### Download the repository containing the project files

1. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/GenesysAppFoundry/genesyscloud-vonage) and clone it to your machine.

### Create an Implicit Grant OAuth

1. Login to your Genesys Cloud organization and create a new OAuth Credential (Implicit Grant). [Create an OAuth Client](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client/)
2. Add **https://localhost/** to the **Authorized redirect URIs**. Note: If you've changed the **redirecUri** value in the config file, then you need to add that new URI instead.
3. In the Scope section, add **users**, **conversations** and **notifications**.
4. Take note of the Client ID. It will be used in the configuration of the project.

### Create a Client Credentials OAuth Grant for Genesys Cloud

1. Login to your Genesys Cloud organization and create a new OAuth Credential (Client Credentials Grant). [Create an OAuth Client](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client/)
2. Select all of the admin **roles** for the OAuth client.
3. Take note of the Client ID and Client Secret.

### Create or use existing Vonage Video API credentials

1. Create or open an existing Vonage Video project from your Vonage account. The project needs to be a Custom Project (OpenTok API) and not an Embed Project.
2. Take note of the Project API Key and Project secret.

### Create a configuration file

1. In the project directory, make a copy of the [sample-config.js](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/vonage-video-blueprint/blob/master/sample-config.js) file and rename it to **config.js**.
2. Enter the values required in the file.

### (Optional) Set up an Email Queue for email invitations

If you want to send invitations to the Vonage Video Room via email, then a queue is required.
For more information about queues and how to create them, read this [article](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/queues/).

1. Once you have a queue, take note of the queue ID. It can be found using an [API query](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/v2/routing/index.html) or if using the Genesys Cloud UI, in the URL.
![1](images/queue_id.png "1")
2. Enter the Queue ID into the config file.

NOTE: Make sure that agents who access the interaction widget are also members of the queue.

### (Optional) Purchase SMS number for SMS invitations

If you want to send invitations to the Vonage Video Room via SMS, then a dedicated SMS number is required.

For more details on purchasing SMS numbers, read this [article](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/purchase-sms-numbers/).
